Extended Kalman Filter Project
Overview

This project implements an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for sensor fusion. The goal is to track objects by combining measurements from both radar and lidar sensors. The project was developed as part of the Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree.

Features

Implements a Kalman Filter for linear measurements (lidar).

Implements an Extended Kalman Filter for non-linear measurements (radar).

Computes Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to evaluate estimation accuracy.

Supports visualization and logging of the estimates.

Exports estimation and ground truth data to CSV for analysis.
